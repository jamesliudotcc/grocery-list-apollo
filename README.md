I wanted to spend a large chunk of this project focused on the front end with React, so I needed to stand up a backend relatively quickly. Since I was already comfortable in Python and went through half of Django for Beginnners during the winter break, I knew that I could move quickly using 🎸. Django comes with a lot for free, such as users, and the database. Plus, Django's ORM allows super clean, declarative code which plays well with VSCode.

GraphQL is teh new shinyz 🌅. That's all of why. There was no reason why this could not have been accomplished more easily using 🛌💤. The Graphene implementation was easy to work with, and the tutorials in [howtographql](https://www.howtographql.com/) are pretty close to what I'm doing. My goal was to get the whole backend up and running with my basic graph queries by the end of Monday. I did some work over the weekend, but not all that much. Thus, I chose not to try and cobble this together using Elixir, even though there was a tutorial for it.

React because I need to get good at one front end framework. This is one more week along that journey.
